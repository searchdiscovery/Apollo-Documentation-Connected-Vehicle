## Attached Notes

<p>Fire whenever a user is presented with a form on a page. This could include a form scrolling into a user viewport (ie footer forms, below-the-fold forms), when a form is dynamically loaded, a 'pop-up' form, or when a page is contextually loaded for the purpose of completing a form.</p>
<p>This event should only be fired once per unique form on page; avoid scenarios where the user may scroll up/down page, and continously fire this event, when the form enters the user's viewport.</p>
